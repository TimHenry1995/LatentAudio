Yamnet's latent space appears to be encode the materials and actions involved in making a sound. In order to understand these latent representaitons, the current notebook explores the latent space and then disentangles it.\n",

        "The preparation for these two analyses is similar in many ways. They both require the conversion of data from its waveform domain to Yament's latent representation for each layer and the projection to manageable dimensionality, e.g. 64 dimensions using PCA. Note that computing a full PCA model is resource intensive and a small model with e.g. 64 dimensions will suffice for most layers. For the majority of layers, the original latent space representations that are of higher dimensionality than the projection are also no longer needed after projection. Only the layers whose latent space shall be manipulated need the full PCA model for invertability and need the original latent space representation. In the curernt study, this only applies to layer 9. The below diagram illustrates this pipeline. Containers represent entire data sets, square represent single data points (i.e. a single sound), scripts refer to code snippets and rectangles represent models. While $W_1$ is the original waveform data, $W_2$ is the augmented one. $Z'$ is Yamnet's latent representation and is obtained for every layer. $Z$ is the latent space representation afgter projection to a lower dimension. $Z_a,Z_b$ form a pair of two sounds whose similarity is indicated for actions and materials in $Y_{ab}$. $Z,Y$ correspond to a single sound (in projected latent representation) and its material/ action label.\n",
